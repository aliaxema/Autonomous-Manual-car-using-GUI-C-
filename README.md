# Autonomous-Manual-car-using-GUI-C-


A simple car connected to a PC (wireless), having 2 modes of operation,
that the user can select through the GUI. First mode is manual mode, where the user can control car
movements through the GUI using buttons. Second mode is autonomous mode, when selected through
GUI by user, in which the car keeps moving while avoiding collisions using its on-board sensors
(proximity sensors, e.g. ultrasonic). In all modes, the car will send sensor readings to the PC to display it
on the GUI, while showing a status of (Obstacle in range or No Obstacles) and the distance between the
car and the available obstacle if it exists.
